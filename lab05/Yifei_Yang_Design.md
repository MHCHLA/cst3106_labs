### **Dice Look and Feel:** `#b5c3d2`
Our Yatzy dice bring a unique blend of tradition and modern design. Each die boasts a crisp white color, with pips represented in our primary color. The dice's rounded edges and shadow effect give them a 3D appearance, enhancing the overall user experience.

### **Playing Instructions** 
-   Game Start: Each player rolls a die; the highest roll begins the game.
-   Rolling the Dice: Players can roll the dice up to three times in each turn.
-   Scoring: Points are awarded based on the dice combination rolled.
-   Game End: Once all scorecard combinations are filled, tally the points. The player with the highest score wins!
